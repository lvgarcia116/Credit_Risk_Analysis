# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to employe different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. This analysis uses imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling.


## Results: 
-The results of Naive Random Oversampling is below. The accuracy of this model is 64%, precision for the high risk group is 1%, and the sensitivity/recall is 66%.

-The results of SMOTE Oversample is below. The accuracy of this model is 65%, precision for the high risk group is 1%, and the sensitivity/recall is 69 overall%.

## Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
